In 2025, the festival will take place from July 10 to 13 on the picturesque banks of the Dniester River in the village of Poiana, Moldova, our most beloved and sunny place.

Five hands symbolize collective action, weaving various energies and directions into one harmonious and powerful force. Five hands are artists, musicians, craftsmen, dreamers, those who come to contribute their part to the big picture, creating a world without divisions.",
      "text_2": "One rhythm is the heart of the festival. It is the beat that unites us all, providing space for creativity and mindfulness. It is the rhythm of life, reflected in every moment, every melody, and every movement. It is our goal — conscious creation, where every participant becomes part of something greater than themselves."
